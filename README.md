# Capstone-Project-Salifort-Motors-Project
#### Capstone project: Providing data-driven suggestions for HR
##### Description and deliverables
 This capstone project is an opportunity for you to analyze a dataset and build predictive models
 that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.
 Upon completion, you will have two artifacts that you would be able to present to future employers.
 One is a brief one-page summary of this project that you would present to external stakeholders
 as the data professional in Salifort Motors. The other is a complete code notebook provided here.
 Please consider your prior course work and select one way to achieve this given project question.
 Either use a regression model or machine learning model to predict whether or not an employee
 will leave the company. The exemplar following this actiivty shows both approaches, but you only
 need to do one.
 In your deliverables, you will include the model evaluation (and interpretation if applicable), a data
 visualization(s) of your choice that is directly related to the question you ask, ethical considerations,
 and the resources you used to troubleshoot and find answers or solutions.
 
 The employee’s salary (U.S. dollars)
 ### Reflect on these questions as you complete the plan stage.
 • Whoare your stakeholders for this project?
 • What are you trying to solve or accomplish?
 • What are your initial observations when you explore the data?
 • What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage? (Make sure to include
 the links.)
 • Doyou have any ethical considerations in this stage?
 
 1. Who are your stakeholders for this project?
 Primary Stakeholders: * HR Department at Salifort Motors– They want to understand why
 employees leave and how to reduce attrition. * Company Executives and Management– Interested
 in reducing hiring/training costs and improving team performance.
 Secondary Stakeholders: * Employees– As changes in HR policies could affect their work environment and satisfaction. * Recruitment Team– Will benefit from predictive insights in planning.

 2. What are you trying to solve or accomplish?
 Identify key factors that influence employee attrition and build a predictive model to classify em
ployess as likely to stay or leave. * reduce attrition * Improve job satisfaction * Increase employee
 retention through actionable HR strategies
 3. What are your initial observations when you explore the data?
    
 • The dataset includes 10 features such as satisfaction level, evaluation scores, and workload.
 • There are some potentially duplicated rows, which may affect model accuracy.
 • Some features show non-linear relationships with attrition (e.g., number of projects and av
erage monthly hours).
 • Class imbalance might be present (fewer people left than stayed).

 4. What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage? (Make sure to include
 the links.)

 • Kaggle
 • Seaborn Boxplot
 • Scikit_learn for Classification Models.
 • ROCand AUC explanation
 • Google Advanced Data Analytics Course Resources

 5. Do you have any ethical considerations in this stage?
    
 • Data Privacy- Ensure no personally identifiable information is used.
 • Bias- Be aware of biases in data.
 • Model Impact- Predicitions should not be used punitively but to proactively improve condi
tions.
 • Transparency- HR and employees should be informed how predicitions will be used to support,
 not penalize them
